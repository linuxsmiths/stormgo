This README contains instructions for managing the 3rd party libraries used.
These are the libraries which need to be updated from their original sources.
Run setup.sh in stormgo/3rdparty to setup the symlinks so that python3 can pick
them up.

smartapi-python
===============
The latest working version is checked in, so you use the checked in version.

Instructions for udpating the checked-in working version if AngelOne updates the
code.

cd stormgo/3rdparty

# clone from the smartapi repo.
git clone https://github.com/angel-one/smartapi-python.git

# rm .git directory so that git lets you checkin this version.
rm -fr .git

# then check if there are some local changes we need to make
# grep for TOMAR in the above directory if you are doing a "git pull --rebase"
# make sure those changes are there.

# Alternatively you can copy specific files over the ones in
# /home/tomar/exploits/StockMarket/zerodha/bot/gitrepo/stormgo/3rdparty/smartapi-python/SmartApi/
# and then git commit them locally.

# If the following symlink is not present, create it so that python3 can pick it.
ln -s /home/tomar/exploits/StockMarket/zerodha/bot/gitrepo/stormgo/3rdparty/smartapi-python/SmartApi/ /usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages
